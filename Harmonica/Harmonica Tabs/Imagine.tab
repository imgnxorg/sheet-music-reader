5 6 5     6     -7 -7 -6
Imagine there's no heaven
  5  6 5  6  -7  -6
It's easy if you try
5   6   -7 -7 -6
No hell below us
5 6   5  6 -7  -6
Above us only sky
-6 7 -6  7   8  8 -8
Imagine all the people
-7 -7   -7 7 -8
Living for today
8  9  8 -8 7
A-ha-a-a-ah
-6   7  -7  -6  6 7  7 
You may say I'm a dreamer
-6    7 -7  -7 -6  -5  5
But I'm not the only one
-6 -6    7  -7   -6   7    7   7 
I hope some day you will join us
 7   7  -8   7  -8   8   7   7
When the world will be as one.
