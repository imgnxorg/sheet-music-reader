## Verse

### 1

I used to think that happy endings were only in the movies.

But then I met this one buck 30-pound groupie

I don‚Äôt read books but I got shelves lined

Not cuz I'm fuggin stupid, my life is `undefined` (duh!)

### 2
 
Ain't no fuggin' constant, it's like a  box of chocolates üíù üç´

Ain't no fuckin' cat-e-gory, youuuu can calll it "content"

Yeahhhh, the plotttt thickennns; the storrrry unnnfoldddddss;

develops as we speak; y'all ain't neva been      told

### 3

Mystics been cappin' since the origin of man

They can *tell* "deez nutz" (this *fortune*) innnn my fuckin' hand

"No writing on the wall!" it says the guidelines
 
Consequences "may" result in 30 days of jail time

### 4

My momma told me to "stay away from hoes"

That's real good advice, so as the song goes

Can't get what you want, but what do you need?

Imgnxtion Unleashed; welcome to the dream.


Indulge in the intangeable, reveries, nightmares, fantansies, the visions, and muses,

the spiritual, ephemeral, manifest, fantastically surreal imgnxtion.

Rapt in what you believe, what you feel, what you see, the Holocene, the living and breathing

                      Overdubbed:
                      Imgnxtion Unleashed           Welcome to The Dream 
                      
Under the dub: 
What you receive, you perceive, you conceive, what you trust ‚Äî chaos to order












It's a hallucination

....... trust

Signed, your imagination
