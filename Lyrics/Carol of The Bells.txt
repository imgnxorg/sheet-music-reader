Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear

Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air
Ding dong ding dong ding

Oh how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Hark how the bell
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear

Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air

On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone 
To every home

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
